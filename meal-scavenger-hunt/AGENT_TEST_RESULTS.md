## Conclusion

**Overall Agent Health**: 100% (5/5 agents healthy)
**Functional Completion**: 20% (1/5 agents fully functional)

The Clue Generator Agent demonstrates full AI-powered functionality and serves as a reference implementation for the other agents. All agents are properly containerized, healthy, and ready for feature implementation. The platform infrastructure is solid and ready for development.

**Next Development Focus**: Implement the remaining 4 agent endpoints to bring the platform to full functionality.
