## 🚀 Choose Your Path to Completion

### **Option 1: Push & Auto-Deploy** (30 seconds)

1. **Push your commit:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lynnoverall/Code/envs/Koopjesjacht/meal-scavenger-hunt
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Tell me "pushed"** - I'll redeploy via Hostinger API automatically

3. **Done!** All 23 containers will be running in 5-10 minutes

---

### **Option 2: Automated Script** (5 minutes - RECOMMENDED)

Run the deployment script I created:

```bash
cd /Users/lynnoverall/Code/envs/Koopjesjacht/meal-scavenger-hunt
./deploy-to-hostinger.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Connects to your VPS via SSH
- ✅ Clones your public repository
- ✅ Creates missing files automatically
- ✅ Builds all 23 Docker containers
- ✅ Verifies deployment
- ✅ Shows you live logs

**Requirements:**
- SSH access to 72.60.169.105
- Your VPS root password (from Hostinger panel)

---

### **Option 3: Manual GitHub File Creation**

If git push doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/loverallgithub/Koopjesjacht
2. Navigate to: `frontend/public/`
3. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
4. Name: `static-index.html`
5. Content: `<!-- Placeholder -->`
6. Commit directly to main
7. Tell me "file added" - I'll redeploy

If you need to set up SSH:

1. Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Select your VPS
3. Click "Advanced" → "SSH Access"

---

## 📞 What to Tell Me

**If you choose Option 1:**
Just type: "pushed" (after running git push)

**If you choose Option 2:**
Type: "running script" (then follow the prompts)

**If you choose Option 3:**
Type: "file added" (after creating on GitHub)

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Use Option 2** (the script) because:
- ✅ No git authentication needed
- ✅ Creates missing files automatically
- ✅ Handles everything end-to-end
- ✅ Shows you real-time progress
- ✅ Most reliable method

Just run:
```bash
./deploy-to-hostinger.sh
```
