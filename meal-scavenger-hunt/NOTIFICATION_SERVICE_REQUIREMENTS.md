# Notification Service Agent - Requirements & Capabilities

**Agent**: Notification Service Agent
**Port**: 9005
**Purpose**: Send real-time notifications to teams during scavenger hunt gameplay

---

## Current Status
‚ùå **Stub implementation** - only has health check endpoint
‚ùå Wrong endpoints (has clue generation code instead of notifications)

## Integration Points

### Stats Aggregator Integration
**Events to Listen For**:
- Venue scan ‚Üí Send confirmation notification
- Hint used ‚Üí Send hint text notification
- Rank changed ‚Üí Send rank update notification
- Hunt completed ‚Üí Send completion notification

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Stats Aggregator calls Notification Service after scan
await axios.post('http://notification-agent:9005/webhook', {
  event: 'venue_checkin',
  team_id: team.id,
  hunt_id: hunt.id,
  data: {
    venue_name: venue.name,
    points_earned: 100,
    new_rank: 2,
    total_points: 200
  }
});
```

### QR Manager Integration
**Events**:
- QR scanned ‚Üí Send clue or venue confirmation
- Invalid QR ‚Üí Send error notification

### Clue Generator Integration
**Events**:
- Clue generated ‚Üí Format and send to team
- Hint requested ‚Üí Send hint with penalty notice

## Notification Templates

### Template: Hunt Start
```javascript
{
  type: 'hunt_start',
  title: 'üéØ Hunt Started!',
  message: 'Your scavenger hunt "{hunt_name}" has started! Scan your first QR code to receive your clue. Good luck!',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  variables: ['hunt_name']
}
```

### Template: Venue Check-in
```javascript
{
  type: 'venue_checkin',
  title: '‚úÖ Venue Checked In!',
  message: 'Congratulations! You found {venue_name}! +{points} points. Current total: {total_points} points.',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  variables: ['venue_name', 'points', 'total_points']
}
```

### Template: Rank Change
```javascript
{
  type: 'rank_up',
  title: 'üìà Rank Improved!',
  message: 'Great job! You moved up to rank {rank} out of {total_teams} teams!',

  variables: ['rank', 'total_teams']
}
```

### Template: Hunt Complete
```javascript
{
  type: 'hunt_complete',

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Notifications (Immediate)
‚úÖ Capability 1: Send team notification
‚úÖ Capability 2: Broadcast to hunt
‚úÖ Capability 3: Notification templates
‚úÖ Capability 4: Webhook for events

### Phase 2: Real-time (Next)

## Storage Strategy

### Redis (for real-time)
- Active WebSocket connections
- Recent notifications (last 1 hour)
- Delivery queue

### PostgreSQL (for persistence)
- Notification history
- User preferences
- Delivery statistics

---

## Technology Stack

### WebSocket: `ws` library
```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 9006 });
```

### Email (Future): Nodemailer
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
```

### SMS (Future): Twilio
```javascript
const twilio = require('twilio');
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- Send notification in < 100ms
- WebSocket message delivery < 50ms
- Support 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections

### Reliability
- 99% delivery success rate
- Automatic retry for failed deliveries
- No duplicate notifications

### Engagement
- 90%+ notification open rate (for critical notifications)
- Real-time delivery for connected clients

---

## Testing Strategy

### Capability Testing (Incremental)
1. **Test Capability 1**: Send notification to single team
2. **Test Capability 2**: Broadcast to multiple teams
3. **Test Capability 3**: Template rendering with variables
4. **Test Capability 4**: Webhook integration with Stats Aggregator
5. **Test Capability 5**: WebSocket connection and message delivery

### Integration Testing
1. Complete hunt workflow with notifications
2. Multi-team scenario with rank changes
3. Error handling (failed delivery, disconnected clients)

---

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Team Scans Venue
```
1. Team scans QR code at venue
2. QR Manager verifies code
3. Stats Aggregator records scan and updates rank
4. Stats Aggregator calls Notification Service webhook
5. Notification Service sends:
   - "Venue checked in! +100 points" to team
   - "Rank update: Now #2" to team
   - "[Team] checked in at [Venue]" to organizer
6. WebSocket pushes live update to all connected clients
```

### Workflow 2: Team Requests Hint
```
1. Team requests hint via frontend
2. Frontend calls Stats Aggregator /track-hint
3. Stats Aggregator applies penalty
4. Stats Aggregator calls Notification Service webhook
5. Notification Service sends:
   - "Hint 1: [hint text] (-15 points)" to team
6. Frontend displays hint
```
