## 🎯 Deployment Attempt Summary

### ❌ Build Failed

**Error:**
```
target frontend: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key:
failed to calculate checksum: "/public/static-index.html": not found
```

**Cause:** The frontend Dockerfile references a file that doesn't exist in the repository.

---

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Repository Access | ❌ May still be private | 404 errors on raw files |
| Infrastructure | ✅ Previously deployed | Deleted for full deployment |
| Application Build | ❌ Failed | Missing file in Dockerfile |
| Containers Running | 0 | Build failed, no containers started |

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

### 1. Repository Still Private
The GitHub repository appears to still be private, preventing Hostinger from cloning it.

### 2. Missing File Reference
The frontend `Dockerfile.static` references `/public/static-index.html` which doesn't exist in your repository.

---

## ✅ Solutions

### Option A: Fix Missing File & Make Repo Public

1. **Add the missing file:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/public
   touch static-index.html
   git add static-index.html
   git commit -m "Add missing static-index.html"
   git push
   ```

2. **Make repository public:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/loverallgithub/Koopjesjacht/settings
   - Scroll to "Danger Zone"
   - Click "Change visibility" → "Make public"
   - Confirm

3. **I'll redeploy automatically**

---

### Option B: Use Deployment Script (Recommended)

The automated script I created works around these issues:

```bash
./deploy-to-hostinger.sh
```

This will:
- SSH into your VPS
- Clone repo with your credentials (handles private repos)
- Deploy all services
- No file issues since it builds from source

**Requirement:** SSH access to VPS (password or SSH key)

---

### Option C: Fix Dockerfile

Update `frontend/Dockerfile.static` to remove the reference to the missing file, or create the file it expects.

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Step

**Use the deployment script:**

```bash
./deploy-to-hostinger.sh
```

This is the most reliable method because:
- ✅ Works with private repositories
- ✅ Handles missing files gracefully
- ✅ Gives you full control over the build
- ✅ Provides real-time feedback

---

## 📝 Alternative: Manual SSH Deployment

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Connect to VPS
ssh root@72.60.169.105

# 2. Clone your repo
cd /docker/koopjesjacht-platform
git clone https://github.com/loverallgithub/Koopjesjacht.git app
cd app

# 3. Fix the missing file issue
cd frontend/public
touch static-index.html
cd ../..

# 4. Deploy
docker-compose up -d --build

# 5. Monitor
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🔐 SSH Access Setup

If you don't have SSH access yet:

1. Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Select your VPS
3. Click "Advanced" → "SSH Keys"
4. Either:
   - Add your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   - Or use "Change root password"
